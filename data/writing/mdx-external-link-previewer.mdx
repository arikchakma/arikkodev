First of all, It is still a work in progress. I will update this post as I go along and make things easy to learn. In addition, I will be adding more features and making it more robust. So, stay tuned.

## Why we should use link preview

While reading any article or blog post, there are many external links. However, we get distracted from the main content whenever we open it. So, we should have a preview of the link before opening it on hover or focus. It will help us to decide whether to open the link or not. Moreover, to keep the attention on the main content.

The main idea came from [Rauno's](https://twitter.com/raunofreiberg) [uiwtf](https://uiw.tf/link-preview) project. Whenever we hover over the link, it will show the preview `screenshot` of the link. It is the main idea of the link preview.

## First code approach

There are many ways of building this particular feature, but in the first approach, I tried to use it on the server side. Like building an `/api/link-preview` endpoint and passing the link as a query parameter. Then, I used [playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to take the link's screenshot and return it as a base64 string. However, this approach has some drawbacks. Like, it will take more time to load the page and take more time to take the screenshot. So, I decided to use the client-side approach. Moreover, it is tricky to host it in [vercel](https://vercel.com).

Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable, and fast.

## Extracting links from the content using regex

I use [contentlayer](https://contentlayer.dev) to convert the content from the markdown files. So, I need to extract the links from the content.

Contentlayer is a content preprocessor that validates and transforms content into type-safe JSON that you can easily import into the application.

I used the following regex to extract the links from the content.

```typescript
// https://morioh.com/p/2f455138edf8
const regXExternalLink =
  /\[(.+)\]\((https?:\/\/[^\s]+)(?: "(.+)")?\)|(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/gi;
```

This is what the `contentlayer.config.ts` looks like. You can check the complete code [here](https://github.com/arikchakma/arikkodev/blob/main/contentlayer.config.ts).

```typescript:contentlayer.config.ts
import { ComputedFields } from 'contentlayer/source-files';

const computedFields: ComputedFields = {
  // ...
  externalLinks: {
    type: 'json',
    resolve: async doc => {
      // https://morioh.com/p/2f455138edf8
      const regXExternalLink =
        /\[(.+)\]\((https?:\/\/[^\s]+)(?: "(.+)")?\)|(https?:\/\/[^\s]+)/gi;

      const externalLinks = Array.from(
        doc.body.raw.matchAll(regXExternalLink)
      ).map((value: any) => {
        const text = value[1];
        const url = value[2];
        if (!url) return;
        // Replacing all the / with @ to avoid folder structure
        const name = (url as string).replace(/[\/#]/g, '@');

        return {
          text,
          url,
          name,
        };
      });

      return externalLinks;
    },
  },
};
```

## Taking the screenshot using playwright

I am manually running the script to take a screenshot of all the links and store them in the `public/previews` folder. However, I am planning to automate the process of taking screenshots.

```javascript:preview-images.mjs
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { chromium } from 'playwright-core';

const allWritings = readFileSync(
  '.contentlayer/generated/Writing/_index.json',
  'utf8'
);

function previewImages() {
  JSON.parse(allWritings).map(writing => {
    writing.externalLinks.map(async externalLink => {
      let browser = await chromium.launch();

      let page = await browser.newPage();
      await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1440, height: 1080 });
      await page.emulateMedia({ colorScheme: 'dark' });
      await page.goto(externalLink.url);
      await page.waitForTimeout(1000);
      await page.screenshot({
        path: `public/previews/${externalLink.name}.png`,
      });
      await browser.close();
    });
  });
}

previewImages();
```

The script

```bash
"post:preview": "NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-json-modules' node ./scripts/preview-images.mjs",
```

And then run `pnpm post:preview` to take the screenshots.

## Building the link preview component

I'm using [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for the popover component. Furthermore, I am using [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for the styling.

```tsx:LinkPreview.tsx
import * as HoverCard from '@radix-ui/react-hover-card';
import cn from 'clsx';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function LinkPreview({
  href,
  children,
}: {
  href: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const name = href.replace(/[\/#]/g, '@');
  return (
    <HoverCard.Root openDelay={50} closeDelay={100}>
      <HoverCard.Trigger asChild>
        <a
          href={href}
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          className={cn(
            'whitespace-nowrap text-[#5d676a] underline decoration-[#5d676a]/60 decoration-1 underline-offset-2 transition-colors duration-100 ease-in-out',
            'opacity-100 hover:opacity-70',
            'active:no-underline active:opacity-70'
          )}
        >
          {children}
        </a>
      </HoverCard.Trigger>
      <HoverCard.Portal>
        <HoverCard.Content
          side="top"
          className="m-2 w-64 origin-bottom animate-preview-popup rounded-lg bg-white p-2 shadow-xl data-[side=bottom]:origin-top"
        >
          <figure className="relative aspect-[1.3333] w-full overflow-hidden rounded-md">
            <Image
              src={`/previews/${name}.png`}
              className="absolute h-full w-full object-top"
              layout="fill"
              alt={name}
            />
          </figure>
        </HoverCard.Content>
      </HoverCard.Portal>
    </HoverCard.Root>
  );
}
```

I am using a delay of `50ms` to open the popover and `100ms` to close the popover. So, it will not open the popover when the user is just hovering over the link. It will only open the popover when the user hovers over the link for `50ms`. It will close the popover when the user is not hovering over the link for `100ms`.

For the popover animations, I'm using CSS animations, and also I'm using the `data-[side=bottom]` attribute to change the origin of the animation.

Here is what my tailwind config looks like.

```js:tailwind.config.js
animation: {
  'preview-popup': '150ms cubic-bezier(0,.79,.19,.99) preview-popup',
},
keyframes: {
  'preview-popup': {
    '0%': {
      transform: 'scale(0.3) translateY(2px)',
      opacity: 0,
    },
    '100%': {
      transform: 'scale(1) translateY(0)',
      opacity: 1,
    },
  },
},
```

## Using the link preview component

Now it's time to replace the normal `a` tag with the `LinkPreview` component in the markdown content.

```tsx:Writing.tsx
export default function Post({
  writing,
}: InferGetStaticPropsType<typeof getStaticProps>) {
  const MDXComponent = useMDXComponent(writing.body.code);

  return (
    // ...
    <MDXComponent
      components={{
        li: (props: any) => <li className="[&>p]:m-0">{props.children}</li>,
        a: (props: any) => {
          return (
            <>
              {props.className ? (
                <a className={`${props.className} font-bold`} href={props.href}>
                  {props.children}
                </a>
              ) : (
                <LinkPreview href={props.href}>{props.children}</LinkPreview>
              )}
            </>
          );
        },
      }}
    />
  );
}
```
