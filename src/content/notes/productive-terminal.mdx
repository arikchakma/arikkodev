I've been using [Z-shell](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/getting-started-zsh) (Zsh) with [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) for a while now. It's a great combination and I love it. I've been using it for a while now and I've customized it to my liking with a few plugins and themes.

> Zsh is a powerful shell that operates as both an interactive shell and as a scripting language interpreter.

## Plugins

I use the following plugins:

- [git aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) - It's a collection of aliases for `git` commands. Instead of typing `git status` I can just type `gst` and it'll do the same thing.

- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Highlight commands while typing.

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - Suggests commands as you type based on history and completions. Really handy when you're trying to remember a command you used a while ago especially for `git` commands.

- [z - jump around](https://github.com/rupa/z) - Tracks your most used directories and allows you to jump to them quickly. I use this all the time to jump to my projects directory. Let's say I wanna jump to one of my projects, I just type `z <project-name>` and it'll jump to that directory.

You can install these plugins by following the instructions on their respective GitHub repositories.
