I've been using [Z-shell](https://opensource.com/article/19/9/getting-started-zsh) (Zsh), [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), and [Iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) for a while now. It's a great combination and I love it. I've been using it for a while now and I've customized it to my liking with a few plugins and themes.

> Zsh is a powerful shell that operates as both an interactive shell and as a scripting language interpreter.

## Plugins

I use the following plugins:

- [git aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git) - It's a collection of aliases for `git` commands. Instead of typing `git status` I can just type `gst` and it'll do the same thing.

- [zsh-syntax-highlighting](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting) - Highlight commands while typing.

- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) - Suggests commands as you type based on history and completions. Really handy when you're trying to remember a command you used a while ago especially for `git` commands.

- [z - jump around](https://github.com/rupa/z) - Tracks your most used directories and allows you to jump to them quickly. I use this all the time to jump to my projects directory. Let's say I wanna jump to one of my projects, I just type `z <project-name>` and it'll jump to that directory.

You can install these plugins by following the instructions on their respective GitHub repositories.

## Shortcuts

Here are some common shortcuts I use:

- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> - Search through your command history.
- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> - For splitting the terminal window horizontally _(Iterm2)_.
- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>D</kbd> - For splitting the terminal window
  vertically _(Iterm2)_.
- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> - Move cursor to the beginning of the line.
- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> - Move cursor to the end of the line. directory.
- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>W</kbd> - Delete the word before the cursor.
- `cd -` - Switch back and forth between the current and previous directory.
- `repeat 5 echo "Hello World"` - Repeat a command 5 times. Useful when testing rate limiting on APIs `repeat 10 curl ...`.

For more shortcuts, you can use `aliases` and `functions`. I have a few of them in my `.zshrc` file. You can check them out `cat ~/.zshrc`.
