Today, I want to share how I tackled a common challenge: deploying updates to the [Maily](https://maily.to) API without any downtime. Imagine updating your app and users suddenly see errors or a "site under maintenance" page. That's what I wanted to avoid! I aimed for seamless updates, where users wouldn't even notice a new version was being rolled out.

[Maily](https://maily.to) helps you craft stunning, responsive emails effortlessly and now itâ€™s more powerful than ever. Beyond just beautiful templates, Maily is now a complete platform for managing your email design workflow, collaboration, and brand consistency in one seamless experience.

> tl;dr: I switched from `pm2 restart` to `pm2 reload` and implemented graceful shutdown in my API.

```diff
- pm2 start dist/server.js --name api-maily
- pm2 restart api-maily
+ pm2 start dist/server.js --name api-maily -i 2
+ pm2 reload api-maily
```

A little bit of background, I was already using `pm2` for the API but incorrectly. I was using it to start the API as a single process. I was not using it to restart the API when I need to deploy a new version. I was using `pm2 restart` to restart the API but it was not working as expected.

## The Challenge

The API is built with Hono and Node.js and relies on various services. When I push a new feature or fix a bug, I need to deploy the new code to my server. The tricky part is making sure this deployment doesn't interrupt anyone using the API.

My initial deployment process involved stopping the old version, putting the new version in place, and then starting it up again. This brief "stop-start" period, even if just a few seconds, meant downtime for users.

## PM2 Magic

To achieve zero downtime, I made two key changes to how I use PM2:

1. **Multiple Instances (Cluster Mode)** <br />
   Instead of running a single instance, I configured PM2 to run multiple copies of the API using cluster mode (`-i 2`). This means I have 2 instances of the API running simultaneously.

2. **Graceful Reload** <br />
   Instead of using `pm2 restart` (which stops all instances at once), I switched to `pm2 reload`. This command performs a "rolling restart" - it starts new instances with the updated code, waits for them to be ready, then gracefully shuts down the old instances.

## The Graceful Reload Process

Here's how `pm2 reload` works its magic:

1. Start New Instances: PM2 starts new instances of the API with the updated code.
2. Health Check: It waits for these new instances to fully start up and become healthy (ready to handle requests).
3. Graceful Shutdown: Only once the new instances are ready, PM2 tells the old instances to shut down gracefully. The old instances stop accepting new requests but finish any requests they're currently handling.
4. Seamless Transition: During this entire process, there are always healthy instances running to serve requests - first the old ones, then both old and new, then only the new ones.

This is like having multiple checkout counters in a supermarket - you open new ones, wait for them to be ready, then close the old ones. Customers keep flowing without interruption!

## Graceful Shutdown

For `pm2 reload` to work perfectly, my Node.js API must know how to shut down "gracefully." This means handling `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` signals (which PM2 sends when it wants to stop an instance).

I added specific handlers in my API code for these signals to:

- Stop accepting _new_ HTTP requests immediately.
- Allow _in-progress_ requests to finish.
- Close connections to external services like my database and Redis cleanly. This prevents database connection leaks or corrupted data.

```ts
// (omitted imports)
import type { ServerType } from '@hono/node-server';

export async function shutdown(server: ServerType | null, signal: string) {
  if (!server) {
    logError('[server]: Server not initialized');
    process.exit(1);
  }

  try {
    logInfo(`[server]: ${signal} received. Initiating graceful shutdown...`);

    // it will wait for all the requests to be processed
    // and then close the server
    await new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
      server.close((err) => {
        if (err) {
          logError(`[server]: Error closing server: ${err.message}`);
        } else {
          logInfo('[server]: HTTP server closed.');
        }
        resolve();
      });
    });

    // clean up resources like database connections, redis connections, etc.
    // this is important to prevent database connection leaks or corrupted data

    logInfo('[server]: All resources cleaned up. Exiting process.');
    process.exit(0);
  } catch (error) {
    logError('[server]: Error during shutdown', error);
    process.exit(1);
  }
}
```

Without these handlers, PM2 would "hard kill" the processes, leading to broken requests and potentially messy resource states.

## Ansible Playbook

I automate this whole process using Ansible. Here's a simplified look at the key steps in my Ansible playbook:

```yaml
- name: clone api-maily
  # Get the latest code to a temporary directory
  git: ...

- name: build api-maily
  # Install dependencies and build the application
  shell: |
    cd "/tmp/api-maily"
    pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
    pnpm run build --force --no-cache --filter=@maily-to/api

- name: copy api-maily
  # Copy the freshly built code to the actual deployment directory
  command: 'cp -r /tmp/api-maily/. {{ api_maily_project_dir }}'

- name: check api-maily running
  # See if PM2 already has our API running
  command: 'pm2 list'
  register: pm2_list

- name: run migrations
  shell: |
    cd {{ api_maily_project_dir }}
    pnpm run db:migrate --filter=@maily-to/db

- name: reload api-maily
  # If the API is running, gracefully reload it
  shell: |
    pm2 reload api-maily
  when: "'api-maily' in pm2_list.stdout"

- name: start api-maily
  # If the API is NOT running (first deployment), start it in cluster mode
  shell: |
    cd {{ api_maily_project_dir }}/apps/api
    pm2 start dist/server.js --name api-maily -i 2
  when: "'api-maily' not in pm2_list.stdout"

- name: save pm2
  # Make sure PM2 remembers the current state of processes across reboots
  command: 'pm2 save'
```

> This is a simplified version of my Ansible playbook. I have more steps and more complex logic in my actual playbook.

## Conclusion

The key to achieving zero downtime for the API was changing how I used PM2. By switching from `pm2 restart` to `pm2 reload` and running multiple instances in cluster mode, combined with implementing graceful shutdown in my API code, I eliminated deployment downtime entirely. Users now experience seamless updates without any service interruptions - a fundamental requirement for robust, production-ready applications.
