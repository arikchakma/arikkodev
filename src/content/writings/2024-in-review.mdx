It's the second version of my annual year in review. 2024 was a great year for me. I've learned a lot of new things, launched a few projects, and improved my skills. I'm excited to share my 2024 in review with you.

1. Went on my first International trip to [Maldives](https://www.instagram.com/p/C3kem0QiHuH3yAAz3d0Z8aKUDRvsQwyvVEJ1r00).
2. I launched [Inboxing.at](https://github.com/arikchakma/mly.fyi).
3. New version of [Maily](https://maily.to) is live with the support of `Section`, `Columns`, `For`, and `Show If` blocks.
4. Started working on a secret new side project (will be announced soon).
5. Launched [Roadmap AI](https://roadmap.sh/ai) in roadmap.sh to generate custom roadmaps.
6. Migration tool for Old Roadmaps using [Roadmap Editor](https://draw.roadmap.sh), custom renderer from editor state to `Svg` and `Pdf`.
7. Onboarding flow for new [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh) users.
8. Launched roadmap specific [Projects](https://roadmap.sh/projects) in roadmap.sh with the ability to submit and share projects.
9. Something new is coming in [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/courses) in 2025, we have built a CMS for that. I am super excited about this. [Kamran](https://x.com/kamrify) and I are working on super hard to make it happen soon.
10. Got backing from [Novu](https://novu.co) to improve Maily editor and add more features. Now you will be able to build more complex emails with Maily, and it will be more user-friendly. All thanks to [Novu](https://novu.co) ([Sokratis Vidros](https://x.com/SokratisVidros), [Naveen Madhan](https://x.com/Navemics), [Tomer Barnea](https://x.com/BarneaCom), and all the amazing team members) for helping me to improve Maily and giving it a proper direction.
11. Built [The tiny Vercel](https://arikko.dev/writings/the-tiny-vercel) to deploy your static sites with `Cloudfront`, `S3`, and `Lambda@Edge`.

> I might have missed a few things, but these are the major things I did in 2024 that I can recall. I will update if I remember anything else.

Along with a lot of stress and managing my university life, 2024 was also a great year. For 2025, I will focus more on my health, building more projects, and mastering my skills. I also plan to learn more about Go, Rust, and building interpreters and compilers.

I am excited about 2025 and hope it will be a great year. Happy New Year to all of you and thank you for being with me in 2024. ðŸŽ‰
