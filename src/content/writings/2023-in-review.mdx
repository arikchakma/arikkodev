Hello fellow reader! I'm starting to do these end-of-year reflections. It will help me to recall what I've done and what I need to improve upon.

1. I joined [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh).
2. We have launched [user accounts](https://twitter.com/kamrify/status/1647012578260819968) in roadmap.sh.
3. I launched [Maily](https://maily.to).
4. I learned about MongoDB, Go, Docker, Ansible, and AWS a lot, thanks to [Kamran Ahmed](https://twitter.com/kamrify) for helping me learn these.
5. We have launched [Teams](https://roadmap.sh/teams) in roadmap.sh. You can now create Teams and Groups to learn with others.
6. We have launched [Questions](https://twitter.com/kamrify/status/1705308902131155370) in roadmap.sh.
7. We have launched [Roadmap Editor](https://twitter.com/kamrify/status/1708293162693767426). Now you can create custom roadmaps, add content and resources, share them with your friends, teams, and publicly.
8. We have introduced [Generate Roadmap from Text](https://twitter.com/kamrify/status/1718242012179075324) for the Roadmap Editor.

Along with a lot of stress and managing my university life, my 2023 was overall a great year. For 2024, I will focus more on Backend and DevOps.
