      I have been doing a lot of open-source and community work over the past
      few years. My open-source work has reached millions of developers via <Link
        href='https://roadmap.sh'>roadmap.sh</Link
      >, <Link href='https://maily.to'>maily.to</Link>, and other projects.
    </p>

    <p class='mb-5'>
      I owe a lot of my success to the amazing people I have met along the way.
      With the hope of doing the same for others, I am offering 15-minute chats
      to anyone who wants to talk about their projects, ideas, or anything else.
      I am happy to help in any way I can.
